To reproduce the controller inheritance bug:

1. Start the server
2. Load http://localhost:3000/broken and then http://localhost:3000/index. The BaseControllers will be inherited correctly - Namespace::BrokenController will inherit Namespace::BaseController and StandardController will inherit BaseController.
3. Restart the server
4. Load http://localhost:3000/index and then http://localhost:3000/broken. Namespace::BrokenController will incorrectly inherit BaseController.

In each case, Namespace::WorkingController will correctly inherit Namespace::BaseController. This means that the problem is caused by putting the controller inheritance inside "module Namespace" instead of explicitly stating which BaseController to inherit.
